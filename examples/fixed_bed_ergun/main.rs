//! **Fixed-bed pressure drop vs the Ergun (1952) correlation** — the dense-regime
//! validation of the *unresolved* (point-particle) DEM–CFD seam, one rung up the
//! coupling ladder from the single-sphere settling case (`settling_sphere`).
//!
//! A static packing of spheres fills a column; gas moves up through it at a
//! prescribed **superficial velocity** `U`. At steady state the streamwise
//! pressure gradient balances the interphase drag the packing exerts on the gas,
//! and the classic packed-bed result is the **Ergun (1952)** correlation
//!
//! ```text
//!   dP/L = 150 (1−ε)²/ε³ · μ U / d²   +   1.75 (1−ε)/ε³ · ρ_f U² / d
//!          └──────── viscous (Blake–Kozeny) ───────┘   └──── inertial (Burke–Plummer) ────┘
//! ```
//!
//! with bed porosity `ε`, particle diameter `d`, superficial velocity `U`.
//!
//! ## Why the *measured* drag is an INDEPENDENT closure (no self-comparison)
//!
//! An earlier version of this example computed the "measured" `dP/L` from the
//! seam's own `beta_gidaspow` closure and compared it to the Ergun formula. That
//! is an **algebraic tautology**: the dense branch of `beta_gidaspow` *is* Ergun
//! (the very same 150 / 1.75 constants), so the measured `dP/L = |ΣF|/(V_bed ε)`
//! reduces IDENTICALLY to `ergun_dp_per_length` for any `ε, U, d` — the relative
//! error is machine-epsilon at every sweep point and the tolerance can never fail.
//! Such a check validates nothing.
//!
//! This version breaks that self-comparison. The **measured** per-particle drag is
//! assembled through the seam from an **independent** packed-bed closure —
//! **MacDonald et al. (1979)**, the "Ergun equation revisited" re-fit of the
//! Blake–Kozeny / Burke–Plummer constants to a much larger data set, which
//! recommends `180` (viscous) and `1.8` (inertial) in place of Ergun's `150` and
//! `1.75` (see [`macdonald_beta`]). Those constants come from data Ergun never saw,
//! so the measured value shares **no constant** with the Ergun *reference*; the
//! relative error is a genuine, non-zero, Reynolds-dependent spread (~5–20 %, the
//! documented inter-correlation difference — largest in the viscous-dominated
//! regime where `180/150 ≈ 1.20`, shrinking toward the inertial end where
//! `1.8/1.75 ≈ 1.03`).
//!
//! ### What that makes falsifiable
//!
//! The pass gate is `|dP/L_meas − dP/L_Ergun| / dP/L_Ergun ≤ tol` with `tol` set to
//! bracket the *documented* MacDonald-vs-Ergun spread. This is **not** a test of
//! the drag constants (Ergun's `150/1.75` and MacDonald's `180/1.8` are two
//! literature fits; neither is "the" truth). It tests that the unresolved seam's
//! **assembly** — deposit a discrete packing to a per-cell void fraction, read the
//! interstitial slip `u_g = U/ε`, evaluate a per-particle drag, sum it, and reduce
//! `Σ_i F_i → dP/L` — reconstructs the macroscopic packed-bed pressure-drop *law*
//! to within that spread. Any of the mistakes a CFD–DEM coupling routinely makes
//! breaks it by **factors far exceeding** the tolerance and the check FAILS:
//!
//!   * a wrong void-fraction power (`ε²` vs `ε³`) → error `~1/ε ≈ 2.5×`;
//!   * superficial `U` mistaken for interstitial `U/ε` in the slip → error `~ε`;
//!   * per-particle → bulk summation wrong (e.g. `V_bed` or the `1−ε` factor) → order-unity error.
//!
//! To prove that (and that the tolerance is not tuned to pass), this example also
//! runs a **negative control**: it re-assembles the SAME sweep with a deliberately
//! corrupted seam (the `ε²`-instead-of-`ε³` bug above) and asserts it would FAIL.
//!
//! ## The deposited void fraction is load-bearing
//!
//! The per-particle drag is driven by a per-cell void fraction **deposited from the
//! actual packing** ([`deposit_bed_void_fraction`]), not an analytic `ε_geo`. For
//! that field to be usable the gas mesh must be **coarser than the particles** —
//! the defining requirement of the *unresolved* regime — so each cell contains
//! *many* sub-cell spheres and its deposited void fraction converges to the bed
//! porosity. The `[mesh]` section sets a gas grid several particle diameters per
//! cell (`d/Δx ≪ 1`); the example gates that the deposited per-cell field is uniform
//! to within `tol_deposit_cell` of `ε_bed` (a real deposition-fidelity check — a
//! mis-binning deposit fails it), and then *uses* that field to evaluate the drag.
//! The binning uses a **containment** locator here in the example: the seam's own
//! `coupling::deposit_void_fraction` uses an interpolation locator tuned for a
//! single SUB-CELL particle and mis-bins at bed scale, so the bed-scale binning
//! lives in this example (per the library-placement rule — one-off to the packed-
//! bed cases). `ε_bed` itself is the exact geometric porosity of the FCC packing,
//! used only for the Ergun reference and the superficial↔interstitial conversion.
//!
//! ## Momentum conservation (kept, but NOT the validation)
//!
//! The two-way momentum sink is still exercised and its conservation checked
//! (`|ΔP_gas + ΣF·dt| / |ΣF·dt| ~ 1e-13`). That is a legitimate property of the
//! seam but it is **not** Ergun-specific — it holds for any drag whatsoever — so it
//! is reported and gated as a sanity check, never counted as the pressure-drop
//! validation.
//!
//! This example imposes the superficial flow (interstitial `u_g = U/ε`) rather than
//! running a full driven compressible flow-through solve past the packing: a
//! porosity-weighted (volume-averaged) momentum solve is the resolved-track story,
//! out of scope for the unresolved seam (cf. the `Cd(Re)` deferral in
//! `cfd_ibm::coupling`). The falsifiability here comes from the *independent* drag
//! reference, not from a flow solve.
//!
//! Everything case-specific is declarative TOML from `argv[1]`:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --release --example fixed_bed_ergun -- \
//!     examples/fixed_bed_ergun/config.toml
